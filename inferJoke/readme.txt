Hi,

This is a draft code that loads the pretrained model and predicts a given input. 
The notebook should run in less than five minutes.

Keep in mind that you should download the following folder (my saved model) and put it in the same folder as your code.

Jian Kai's notes:
- download colbert-trained to root dir(from https://mega.nz/folder/MmB1gIIT#8ilUTK1-BO80aoXxKOIhpg)
- change dataset input dir to "Data" instead of "/kaggle/inputs...."
